### Log file of command line for AMR shotgun project

# get list of reads
cd ~/work/amrbrazil/reads
ls *.fastq > samplist

# get sequence statistics on all fastq files
ls -1 *.fastq.gz | sort | parallel --progress --verbose -j 10 "seqkit stats {} >> stats.txt"

# remove "file" line from within stats.txt
cat stats.txt | (head -1 && grep -v "file" ) > rawstats.txt

# perform fastqc on all files, view some in web browser
# quality does not seem to be a problem at all; only minimum read length
# all reads have minimum read length of 0
# need to remove the short reads first

# trim reads with Trimmomatic for minimum length only
trimmomatic PE read1 read2 -baseout basename.fastq MINLEN:50

## 2/24 problem: two .fastq reads are corrupted - need to be re-copied over from ACI
# G527_13_P1A4_feces_S13_R2_001.fastq
# G527_14_P1A7_feces_S14_R1_001.fastq
##DELETING FOR NOW

## FULL PIPELINE ON THE FIRST 10 FILES
# first get the basenames to do trimmomatic on paired end reads
cat samplist | grep "R1" |  sed 's/_R1_001.fastq.gz//' > basenames

# Trimmomaticcat basenames | head -10 | parallel --progress trimmomatic PE ./reads/{}_R1_001.fastq.gz ./reads/{}_R2_001.fastq.gz -baseout trimmed/trim_{}.fastq.gz MINLEN:50
